Welcome, and thanks for finding me!

Having a genuine curiosity towards discovering how something works, fits together, and pushing it to see what itâ€™s capable of has been a trait of mine since an early age.

"What you designed, architected, built, launched and scaled was one of a kind â€¦ Its flexibility saved the company on many occasions."

I'm currently working on a product called mediafai - which allows your business to leverage your competitors marketing team to promote your products first.

I'm always on the lookout to further improve my knowledge different techniques and tools to solve problems, where I enjoy sharing discoveries with my team and associates to assist them in their roles which in turn reveals developers along the way that also have that hidden itch to discover how things work.

If you have a project or team that could benefit from what I do then please donâ€™t hesitate to send a message my way, I look forward to it!
